# DL_Project_Optuna
Repository for Optuna code demonstration

# How to run
To run the code demonstration, you will need to download the data we used in sdd mini hackathon.
You can find the data in this Google Drive folder :
Once you have downloaded the data, create a `mini-hackathon-data` folder in the root directory of the repository and place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files inside it.

You should have the following file structure :
```
DL_Project_Optuna/
    ├── demo_code.ipynb
    ├── optuna_paper.pdf
    ├── DL_Project_Optuna_Presentation.pdf
    ├── mini-hackathon-data/
    │     ├── train.csv
    │     └── test.csv
    └── ...
```

Enjoy the demo !
